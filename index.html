          <h2>Dedication</h2>
          <small>Gift 1</small>
          <p>
            Dedication is hard work. It means waking up early, sacrificing your
            free time, getting uncomfortable, taking risks, facing failure, and
            delving into the unknown. This is not possible without motivation.
            You need to make the decision to commit. To develop this you need to
            self reflect and refine your goals and most importantly hold
            yourself accountable. If you can't do that you won't have motivation
            to fuel it.

          <h2>Communication</h2>
          <small>Gift 2</small>
          <p>
            Communication is a teachable skill. It is something you can grow and
            develop by practicing things such as simply listening for example.
            You can grow and develop your communication skills by putting
            yourself out there, getting comfortable being uncomfortable. Simply
            talking, whether thats saying hello to someone at the coffee shop or
            interacting with people on linkedin.

          <h2>Resourcefulness</h2>
          <small>Gift 3</small>
          <p>
            Have confidence. Keeping a log of your successes in problem-solving
            will reinforce confidence in yourself. Instead of adopting a
            “can-do” attitude, adopt a “will do at any cost” attitude. Don't
            give up when you can't find an immediate solution or pathway. “Think
            outside of the box” when looking for solutions to problems. At times
            you may need to explore options that may not seem logical or the
            best at the time. Try something different if the first, second or
            third option is not viable.

          <h2>Curiosity</h2>
          <small>Gift 4</small>
          <p>
            Curiosity is a highly valuable skill to develop. It spurs learning
            and the exchange of ideas. There is a theme to most of these. A good
            way to develop curiosity as a skill is to get uncomfortable. When
            you push yourself to do things you never had and really explore that
            curiosity it helps expand what you are capable of.
